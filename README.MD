## Flask API Assignment for Coder Academy 

Weather Master is a Flask API that allows you to look up the weather forecast of any city in the world using the OpenWeatherMap API.

both the application and the OpenWeatherMap API and a web browser and the application. The Weather Master presents a web page with an input where a user can type in a city. By clicking on the "Add City" button, the city is added to a database and then a request is made to the OpenWeatherMap API. The API returns the temperature, a brief description of the weather, a weather icon, humidity reading and cloud coverage reading. Using the bootstrap framework, this data is organised into two columns for clean display. 





## Dependencies

- Flask
- Requests
- OS
- Dotenv
- SQLAlchemy
- Flake8



## To Work On Next

The following is what I would like to add for V2.0

- The ability to delete cities from the page so the list doesn't become too long
